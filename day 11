  list:-list comtains ordered elements and which cn accept d
  arraylist it  is a dynamic array and it can 



  ca
  fro the give array we hqave to find max sum of subarrays ex
  exx  123
  from that subarraya write allt the subarraya 
  to find max of sub arraya for optimal sol we can use kedanes aloga
  step 1 initalize 2 vari
  1 is for indivial sumss and 2 var for max sum and inlitalize with extream 
  run a loop from 0 to n-1 
  alwaysudate max val  
  our target is to get the max sum if we carry max val
  the over of sum is redused 
  if we get sum less than 0 restart sum .
