backtracking it is an example of recursion we have only two steps taking thevaluse not taking the values when ever we reach base case print all the base case elementexs
    when the Array length is = to original array length 
    in every recursion calll remove the laast element and it will backtrack


dutch nationall flag alogoritam

the element between m and h are not sorted and we have to run  a loop from m to h 
if both crosses it means we are reaching each and every element
if array of m
after swapping increses m and l
if array of m is = 1 just move m pointers 
if arraya of m is = 2 swap array of m whith h














    subset: for a given array will get 2`n subset
      subset should be sequence not in continous
